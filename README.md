Final School Project @ ITT G. Marconi Rovereto 

This is the repo for the project I did in 2017 for the final exam.

It is a little Social Network and can be used to make public posts (text/photos). The photos will be visible on a map, so it can be used to keep track of where one took a photo.

It uses Bing API and OSM maps.

Everything was done by me, I won't update this project, feel free to use it or ask me questions.
